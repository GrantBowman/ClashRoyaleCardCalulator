# ClashRoyaleCardCalulator
A little program that takes a card rarity, level, and count and outputs how high you can level it up and at what expense.

This solves the problem of a new card being released, or even from early in a player's experience, of having a lot of cards for a card at level 1. The player believes they have enough to bring it up to a competitive level, so they dump a lot of gold on the card only to realize they misjudged or are a couple dozen or so short to attain the desired level. Now they are low on gold, lacking in significant levels to donate that card to their clan members, and still can't use that card.
